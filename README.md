# Hotel-floor-room-price-calculator
Haven't uploaded in awhile as I found most of the comp sci projects starting early college were pretty simple. Anyways, I found this project interesting, took me a day to do but has some components that every programmer should know. Such as how to use the for loop counter(i) to your advantage, special conditional if statements in loops, and resetting to a point in the program when a error by the user is made. Thats why I decided to upload it here, If somehow I forget these key techniques I will always have this. Also the project is in C++.
